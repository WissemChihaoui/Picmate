        <h2>Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h2>
       <h4>Privacy Policy</h4> 
       <p> Picmate LLC operates a Fairy tales stories application (My Favorite Fairy Tales or Service), and related platform features available through mobile devices and tablets through the associated app.</p>
        
    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
        
<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>
        
<h6>Information Collection and Use</h6>

<p>Currently the app does not use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. However, there is always possibility to use such services to improve app user experience in the future and that information will be included in this document if/when such integrations are done.</p>
        
       <h6> Security</h6>
        
    <p> We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
       <h6> Links to Other Sites</h6>
        
    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
        
        <h6>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h6>
        
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
        
        <h6>Changes to This Privacy Policy
        </h6>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
        
        <h6>Contact Us</h6>
        
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us by sending an email to <a class="mail" href="mailto:hello@picmateapps.com"> hello@picmateapps.com</a>.</p>
        
         
        
        <h4>Terms of Use</h4>
    <p>By downloading or using My Favorite Fairy Tales app, these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. Youâ€™re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. Youâ€™re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldnâ€™t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Picmate LLC.</p>
        
<p> Picmate LLC is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what youâ€™re paying for.</p>
        
    <p>Itâ€™s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We, therefore, recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phoneâ€™s security features and it could mean that the app wonâ€™t work properly or at all.</p>
        
        <p> You should be aware that there are certain things that Picmate LLC will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Picmate LLC cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you donâ€™t have access to Wi-Fi, and you donâ€™t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
        
            <p>If youâ€™re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, youâ€™re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which youâ€™re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        
                <p>Along the same lines, Picmate LLC cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app, that is, you need to make sure that your device stays charged â€“ if it runs out of battery and you canâ€™t turn it on to avail the Service, Picmate LLC cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        
                    <p> With respect to Picmate LLCâ€™s responsibility for your use of the app, when youâ€™re using the app, itâ€™s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Picmate LLC accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
        
                        <p> At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android and iOS â€“ the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and youâ€™ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Picmate LLC does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS/Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

    <p>We may update our Terms of Use from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
        
        <h6>Contact Us</h6>
